This is a Minecraft Mod that is an addon for Kamkeel's CustomNPC+. It adds a new global folder in {Your Minecraft Instance}/customnpcs. 
In this global folder you can put data from any of your worlds into this folder and when a new world is created, those files will be copied into
your new world's customnpcs folder.

This mod is intended to be used on version 1.9.3 and no guarentees on its effectiveness
can be made about previous versions. For versions after 1.10.1, see https://github.com/LoomingVeil/Extended-Scripts. Extended Scripts has all of this mod's features
and more. This mod was made because I was unable to make Extended Scripts compatable with CustomNPC v1.9.3.
